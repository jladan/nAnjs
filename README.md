# Introduction

nAnjs was meant to be a library providing the tools for numerical analysis in the browser 100% clientside. I decided to convert the library to typescript, and provide separately compiled javascript libraries. Please see [nAnts](https://github.com/jladan/nAnts/) for the newer typescript-based version.

The primary goal is to perform accurate and efficient mathematical simulations in the browser, without requiring any additional libraries. This is not a large-scale numerical analysis library, so don't expect to use it for large, high-dimensional problems.

# Features

Performance is attained by using flat arrays for all multidimensional matrix manipulation. Algorithms are chosen by accuracy/stability first, then speed. Often, multiple algorithms will be offered for the same task.

The various tools are split into modules based on problem type

## nAn\_ODE\_module
Numerical solvers for ODE's of the form *x*'(t)=*F*(*x*,t). Methods available include

* Improved Forward Euler (aka. Heun's Method or 2-step Runge-Kutta).
* Adams-Bashford (2-step).
* Leap-frog (central difference time-stepping).

## nAn\_stochastics\_module
Numerical solvers for Stochastic differential equations of the form d*x*(t)=*A*(*X*,t)dt + B(*X*,t) n(t)dt. Where n(t) is some kind of noise. Methods available include

* Euler-Maruyama (Gaussian white noise)
* Milstein (Gaussian white noise)
* Heun's method with coloured noise (generated via an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process)

This module also includes a Gaussian random number generator.

## nAn\_algebra\_module
A module for real-valued matrix algebra.
